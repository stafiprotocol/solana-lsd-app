# solana-lsd-app

Solana LSD App is a user interface where users can stake, unstake and get latest information about the project. As a convention in web3 all API users interact with are directly from the RPC configured in wallet, so the app is a pure DApp.

## Setup Node.js env

1. Install Node.js >= v16
2. Install yarn via npm: `npm install --global yarn`
3. Enter project root directory then install all dependencies via terminal: `yarn`
4. Start app by: `yarn dev`

## Config your app

In normal case you do not need update ABI files, but if you modify the contracts then you probably want to update abi files which are in `config/abi` folder.

- Change branding links and text here: `config/appConf/app.json`
- Set your network contract address on Holesky here: `config/appConf/dev.json`
- Set your network contract address on Mainnet here: `config/appConf/prod.json`

## Customize theme

You can change color config in `tailwind.config.js`, each color has light & dark versions(i.e text1 & text1Dark).

## Build and deploy

Run `yarn build` or `yarn build:dev` to build your app, the static files will be placed in `out` folder. Upload those files to any static web hosting services you like.
